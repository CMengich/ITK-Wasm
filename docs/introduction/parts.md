# Constituent Parts

ITK-Wasm's goal is **to work harmoniously with WebAssembly (wasm) community standards to make the new stack for scientific computing a reality**.

ITK-Wasm adds the glue that enables _simple, performant, easy-to-reason about, composable, interoperable, and universally deployable_ wasm modules to be created by your average [research software engineer](https://ukrse.github.io/who.html). This includes the ability to operate performantly on scientific datasets, with an emphasis on multi-dimensional spatial data.

Towards that end, ITK-Wasm provides **powerful, joyful** tooling for *scientific computation* in wasm through a number of distinct but related parts.

1. Example packages built with ITK-Wasm
2. File format support
3. TypeScript / JavaScript core tooling
4. Python core tooling
5. C++ core tooling

Support for additional languages is planned, and the architecture is easily extensible to support new languages. There interest in [Java](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITK-Wasm/pull/855) and Rust in particular -- if you are interested in contributing code or funding to this effort, [please reach out](https://github.com/thewtex).

This section provides a high level overview of these constituent parts.

(packages)=
## Example packages

While most ITK-Wasm packages are not developed in the `InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITK-Wasm` repository -- a package built with ITK-Wasm can be developed by anyone and maintained in any repository -- there are a number of packages developed in the `ITK-Wasm` repository. These packages

- provide common functionality for other packages, such as testing and IO functionality
- demonstrate capabilities
- and continuously exercise and test the base functionality

To create your own ITK-Wasm package, an [interactive command line setup tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-itk-wasm) is available.

Descriptions of these packages can be found in the [package listing page](./packages.md).

(file-format)=
## File format support

Assistance for handling data serialized in file formats plays a crucial role in enabling comprehensive analysis using a variety of software tools.

ITK-Wasm offers IO modules designed to interact with various standard scientific image, mesh, and spatial transformation file formats. These modules allow for the loading of data into language-native interface types through bindings like TypeScript and Python.

In addition to supporting external file formats, ITK-Wasm also introduces its own file formats. These ITK-Wasm file formats are optimized and offer a direct correspondence to spatial interface types, utilizing a straightforward JSON + binary array buffer format.

More information can be found in the [File Format Section](./file_formats/index.md).

(typescript-core)=
## üåê TypeScript / JavaScript core

In TypeScript / JavaScript, the NPM [`itk-wasm`](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=itk-wasm) package provides:

1. Support for Node.js and browser environments
2. A Command Line Interface (CLI)
3. A Web Worker pool for parallel processing

The `itk-wasm` *command line interface (CLI)* drives

1. Builds
2. Generation of language bindings and language package configuration
3. Testing for wasm binaries

To create your own ITK-Wasm package, an [interactive command line setup tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-itk-wasm) is also available.

(python-core)=
## üêç Python core

A small, Pythonic library, [itkwasm](https://pypi.org/project/itkwasm/), is used by generated bindings to provide simple, clean, performant, and idiomatic interfaces in Python.

The `itkwasm` Python package provides:

1. A simple, Pythonic interface
2. A bridge to NumPy and ITK
3. A plugin system for accelerator packages

Both system execution and browser execution are supported, with the former enabled by [wasmtime-py](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-py) and latter enabled by [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org).

(cxx-core)=
## üßë‚Äçüíª C++ core

ITK-Wasm's C++ core tooling provides:

1. Fundamental numerical methods and multidimensional scientific data structures
2. An elegant, modern interface to create processing pipelines
3. A bridge to interoperable web techologies
4. A bridge to Web3 and traditional desktop computing

These are embodied in the C++ core with:

1. [ITK]
2. [CLI11]
3. [glaze]
4. [libcbor]

The Insight Toolkit ([ITK]) is an open-source, cross-platform library that provides developers with an extensive suite of software tools based on a proven, spatially-oriented architecture for processing scientific data in two, three, or more dimensions.
ITK includes fundamental numerical libraries, such as [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page).
ITK's C++ template-based architecture inherently helps keep wasm modules small while enabling the compiler to add extensive performance optimizations.
The *itk-wasm* GitHub repository is also an [ITK Remote Module](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITKModuleTemplate), `WebAssemblyInterface`, that implements wasm-interface specific functionality.

Wasm module C++ processing pipelines are written with [CLI11]'s simple and intuitive interface.

[glaze] provides elegant, modern C++ interfaces via compile-time reflection for [JSON](https://json.org)-related functionality that is not only [extremely fast](https://github.com/stephenberry/glaze?tab=readme-ov-file#performance) but also extremely small, which is critical for WebAssembly.

The ability to read and write to files, providing a bridge to [Web3] and traditional desktop computing, is built on [libcbor], which is another tiny footprint library.

(docker)=
### Build environment Docker images

Build environment Docker images encapsulate

1. The ITK-Wasm C++ core
2. An [Emscripten] or [WASI] toolchain
3. Additional wasm tools and configurations

These [`itkwasm/emscripten`] and  [`itkwasm/wasi`] Docker images are [dockcross] images -- Docker images with pre-configured C++ cross-compiling toolchains that enable easy-application, reproducible builds, and a clean separation of the build environment, source tree, and build artifacts.

These images include not only the CMake pre-configured toolchains, but pre-built versions of the ITK-Wasm C++ core. Moreover, wasm tools for optimization, debugging, emulation and system execution, testing, are bundled. A number of build and system configurations are included to make optimized and debuggable builds for scientific codebases a breeze.
